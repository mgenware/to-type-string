## Commands

### Common Commands
* `yarn dev` starts the development mode, which watches and compiles all source files including tests files.
* `yarn t` runs tests in development mode. usually, you keep two terminal tabs, one for `yarn dev`, the other for `yarn t`.
* `yarn test` or `yarn build` cleans, lints, compiles sources and runs tests.

### Other Commands
Normally, you do not need to manually run these commands, they are already integrated into other commands.

* `yarn lint` lints the whole project using TSLint, auto triggered by `yarn test`.
* `yarn clean` removes the compiled files, auto triggered by `yarn dev` and `yarn test`.
* `yarn compile` compiles all TypeScript source files, auto triggered by `yarn dev` and `yarn test`
